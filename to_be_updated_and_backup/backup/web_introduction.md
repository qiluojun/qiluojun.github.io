# Introduction

Welcome to my website!

{% emoji blobcat ablobcatattentionreverse %}

The functionality of the website is very, very simple. It is currently not bound to a private server, so it is just a static site.

In the future, I will add a server and make it "come alive"!

## What's the content of this blog?

This blog is overall an introduction! If you want to quickly understand me and my website, reading this one is enough!

## Hello! ðŸ¥³ Who am I?

I am Tang Jia, a senior psychology student~

### What kind of person am I?
- I really love music!

In terms of musical instruments, I once learned the piano and guitar for a while, but they have been gathering dust now... I hope to pick them up again in the future!

There are even more instruments that I treat as toys: harmonica, thumb piano, flute, hulusi, harmonica... I can only play a few simple tunes on them (playing the flute is not as easy as it sounds!). A special thanks to my brother who gives me a small musical instrument every year! Hehe!

Oh, by the way, does whistling count as a musical instrument? It took me about a month to master this skill!

- I really love sports!

At first, it was to focus on health and help manage academic stress~ But after I unlocked push-ups and 5km, I started to fall in love with it and gradually approached pull-ups and 10km!

A lot of sweat and endorphins! So much sense of achievement!

And recently, the pressure has been particularly high... If not for

- I used to love reading... I will try to pick it up again!

I used to read a lot of miscellaneous books and was a regular at the library. However, now I go to the library mainly for self-study... Embarrassing... ðŸ˜­

But thanks to my previous readings, if it weren't for those books on cognitive science, philosophy of mind, sociology, and political science, I wouldn't be on the path I am today~

# What am I doing now

*In general, I am striving to achieve my academic ideals!*

### Applying for further studies

**Being protected in a nutshell, still, my current state feels very hard...**

Anxiety, confusion, procrastination, and other issues often emerge to bombard me. Looking around, I feel that everyone is under a lot of pressure and very tired...

This is just a statement from a student who is still protected by the school's ivory tower! So, there are so many people in the world with much worse conditions and more unfortunate... What should they do?

I used to struggle a lot with this question. On one hand, I felt that I had to do something, but on the other hand, I felt powerless and too insignificant.

Later, I gradually realized that this issue is very complex, and what I can do and how much I can do is also a question that needs to be explored slowly! I can't figure it out now with a lack of information and practical experience! I can't just lose hope foolishly and waste time internally without actually doing anything!

So, if my academic abilities are still sufficient, and if I am lucky, perhaps I can research? Continue to learn and explore while doing something useful for everyone?

It's difficult to go in the direction I want to go in for further studies in China, and most places abroad are very expensive... So, I am currently trying to apply to Japan!

> This opportunity is really delightful: When I was a junior, in order to play games, I bit the bullet and started to learn Japanese on my own. Then one thing led to another... If I were to go back two years and tell myself that I would study abroad in Japan, I would definitely not believe it.

I was very, very fortunate to find a project in Japan that perfectly matches my interests! But due to the issue of professional span, I might be eliminated... Thinking about this, I can't help but feel the pressure is overwhelming ðŸ˜­

But I would rather regret than regret not trying at the time! Keep going! After all, I really want to learn about promoting well-being for myself and everyone else! Keep going!!! 

### Learning and Exploring

- LAE Program - The big picture!
When I was a junior, I gradually established my goal, I want to LIVE AND ENJOY!!!
> Later, I realized that the 'A' in LAE stands for AND ðŸ˜­ ... It's okay! AND is also very important! If others don't value you, I do!

Then I started to write some programs with Python to help me achieve this (later I found out that the LAE program's function is actually to assist self-regulation).

Currently, the PC version of the program has more features, which can record what I do every day, how much time I spend, generate markdown notes (linked with Obsidian), and summarize and analyze. It can also remind me to stand up and take a break when I've been using it for too long.

But this is far from enough! So, I am developing the mobile version (LAE_kivy), with the ultimate goal of connecting all individual electronic devices! And I am trying to develop this website, from being a one-man show to going online!

- Github - Is this open-source ideology?!

I started using Github to download and use software and code from various big names a long time ago.

But it was not until March of this year that I had the idea of using Github to host LAE!

Although my current level is very amateur, I hope that one day I can also contribute to this big family!

Keep going!!!
