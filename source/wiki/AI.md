# Introduction

Since a slew of Large Language Models (LLMs) emerged, learning has become very free and flexible, especially when it comes to languages!

Previously, I was using ANKI for language review. But the problem is that recalling with flashcards doesn't stimulate my brain very well!

So, it's time to unleash the power of AI!!!

Finally, a shout-out: LLMs are awesome!!!最高！！！ 🥳


# Methods and Progress

## Basic Approach

*Use AI to enrich the review of grammar and vocabulary, and increase the opportunities for "use"*

Export review cards from ANKI that meet specific conditions (make good use of specific templates, symbols, and tags for annotation)

Then, hand them over to GPT to create questions

It is necessary to design the corresponding **prompt** in advance

## Progress

- ANKI templatization √
- Card export √
- Prompt creation # In Progress
> Need to enrich the types of questions and adopt different examination methods for grammar and vocabulary usage
