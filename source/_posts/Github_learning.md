# Github in Progress!

## What am I doing with Github?

- Learning version control
  Great! Github Desktop is really convenient~
- Exploring collaboration and project features
  Although I don't have a team yet ðŸ˜­

## Project Description

1. [LAE_PC](https://github.com/qiluojun/LAE_PC) 

   This is the core project! The functionality of the LAE_PC program is central, which will subsequently drive the development of the mobile side (kivy).
   For feature explanations and development plans, please check the its github page~

2. [gh-pages](https://github.com/qiluojun/qiluojun.github.io) 
   
   This is the repository for hosting this website~

   Although it's likely that this website will be moved to another server in the future to implement dynamic features.

3. [reminder](https://github.com/qiluojun/reminder) 
   
   A trial use of Github hosting, so I chose the simplest program to put up~

   Of course, I will continue to update its features in the future because its functionality is also needed for LAE!

4. [LAE_kivy](https://github.com/qiluojun/LAE_kivy) 

   The mobile part of LAE! I found that developing the program's functionality is not the most difficult part; the most challenging part is adapting to the completely different environments of mobile and PC...
