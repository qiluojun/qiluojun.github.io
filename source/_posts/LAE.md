# Live and Enjoy!!!!

## What is this?

This is a personal motto I've formed during my university years! Life is not easy, and I truly wish that I and others can achieve this goal!

It also reflects my simple understanding of life, which is that happiness and joy require effort! "Enjoy" requires efforts!

> Of course, happiness in this world is not something that can be guaranteed with equal effort... That's another grand issue!

## LAE Program and Academic Interests

Starting from my junior year, I began to write a series of simple programs with the goal of LAE to help myself achieve happiness better. With the study of theory, I gradually realized that what I was doing was actually assisting self-regulation through digital tools.

> For detailed descriptions of the program, please refer to the [explanation on GitHub](https://github.com/qiluojun/LAE_PC).

As I continued to learn and explore, I slowly realized that I wanted to learn more knowledge and technology to better accomplish this task. At the same time, I also questioned and pondered whether doing this alone (assisting self-regulation) could lead to true happiness and joy.

With these questions in mind, I decided to continue my research in the field of HCIÃ—Welfare during my master's studies. However, this path may not be very smooth.

I don't know if I am fortunate enough, or if I can persist to the end amidst pressure and uncertainty. Everything is still uncertain. But as long as there is hope, then let's continue to strive!

Keep going!!!!
