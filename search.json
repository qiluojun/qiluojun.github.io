Life is not easy, and I truly wish that I and others can achieve this goal! It also reflects my simple understanding of life, which is that happiness and joy require effort! ‚ÄúEnjoy‚Äù requires efforts! Of course, happiness in this world is not something that can be guaranteed with equal effort‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs another grand issue! LAE Program and Academic InterestsStarting from my junior year, I began to write a series of simple programs with the goal of LAE to help myself achieve happiness better. With the study of theory, I gradually realized that what I was doing was actually assisting self-regulation through digital tools. For detailed descriptions of the program, please refer to the explanation on GitHub. As I continued to learn and explore, I slowly realized that I wanted to learn more knowledge and technology to better accomplish this task. At the same time, I also questioned and pondered whether doing this alone (assisting self-regulation) could lead to true happiness and joy. With these questions in mind, I decided to continue my research in the field of HCI√óWelfare during my master‚Äôs studies. However, this path may not be very smooth. I don‚Äôt know if I am fortunate enough, or if I can persist to the end amidst pressure and uncertainty. Everything is still uncertain. But as long as there is hope, then let‚Äôs continue to strive! Keep going!!!!"},{"title":"Github_learning","path":"/2024/04/10/Github_learning/","content":"Github in Progress!What am I doing with Github? Learning version controlGreat!

The functionality of the website is very, very simple. It is currently not bound to a private server, so it is just a static site. In the future, I will add a server and make it ‚Äúcome alive‚Äù! What‚Äôs the content of this blog?This blog is overall an introduction! If you want to quickly understand me and my website, reading this one is enough! Hello! ü•≥ Who am I?I am Tang Jia, a senior psychology student~ What kind of person am I? I really love music! In terms of musical instruments, I once learned the piano and guitar for a while, but they have been gathering dust now‚Ä¶ I hope to pick them up again in the future! There are even more instruments that I treat as toys: harmonica, thumb piano, flute, hulusi, harmonica‚Ä¶ I can only play a few simple tunes on them (playing the flute is not as easy as it sounds!). A special thanks to my brother who gives me a small musical instrument every year! Hehe! Oh, by the way, does whistling count as a musical instrument? It took me about a month to master this skill! I really love sports! At first, it was to focus on health and help manage academic stress~ But after I unlocked push-ups and 5km, I started to fall in love with it and gradually approached pull-ups and 10km! A lot of sweat and endorphins! So much sense of achievement! And recently, the pressure has been particularly high‚Ä¶ If not for I used to love reading‚Ä¶ I will try to pick it up again! I used to read a lot of miscellaneous books and was a regular at the library. However, now I go to the library mainly for self-study‚Ä¶ Embarrassing‚Ä¶ üò≠ But thanks to my previous readings, if it weren‚Äôt for those books on cognitive science, philosophy of mind, sociology, and political science, I wouldn‚Äôt be on the path I am today~ What am I doing nowIn general, I am striving to achieve my academic ideals! Applying for further studiesBeing protected in a nutshell, still, my current state feels very hard‚Ä¶ Anxiety, confusion, procrastination, and other issues often emerge to bombard me. Looking around, I feel that everyone is under a lot of pressure and very tired‚Ä¶ This is just a statement from a student who is still protected by the school‚Äôs ivory tower! So, there are so many people in the world with much worse conditions and more unfortunate‚Ä¶ What should they do? I used to struggle a lot with this question. On one hand, I felt that I had to do something, but on the other hand, I felt powerless and too insignificant. Later, I gradually realized that this issue is very complex, and what I can do and how much I can do is also a question that needs to be explored slowly! I can‚Äôt figure it out now with a lack of information and practical experience! I can‚Äôt just lose hope foolishly and waste time internally without actually doing anything! So, if my academic abilities are still sufficient, and if I am lucky, perhaps I can research? Continue to learn and explore while doing something useful for everyone? It‚Äôs difficult to go in the direction I want to go in for further studies in China, and most places abroad are very expensive‚Ä¶ So, I am currently trying to apply to Japan! This opportunity is really delightful: When I was a junior, in order to play games, I bit the bullet and started to learn Japanese on my own. Then one thing led to another‚Ä¶ If I were to go back two years and tell myself that I would study abroad in Japan, I would definitely not believe it. I was very, very fortunate to find a project in Japan that perfectly matches my interests! But due to the issue of professional span, I might be eliminated‚Ä¶ Thinking about this, I can‚Äôt help but feel the pressure is overwhelming üò≠ But I would rather regret than regret not trying at the time! Keep going! After all, I really want to learn about promoting well-being for myself and everyone else! Keep going!!! Learning and Exploring LAE Program - The big picture!When I was a junior, I gradually established my goal, I want to LIVE AND ENJOY!!! Later, I realized that the ‚ÄòA‚Äô in LAE stands for AND üò≠ ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs okay! AND is also very important! If others don‚Äôt value you, I do! Then I started to write some programs with Python to help me achieve this (later I found out that the LAE program‚Äôs function is actually to assist self-regulation). Currently, the PC version of the program has more features, which can record what I do every day, how much time I spend, generate markdown notes (linked with Obsidian), and summarize and analyze. It can also remind me to stand up and take a break when I‚Äôve been using it for too long. But this is far from enough! So, I am developing the mobile version (LAE_kivy), with the ultimate goal of connecting all individual electronic devices! And I am trying to develop this website, from being a one-man show to going online! Github - Is this open-source ideology?! I started using Github to download and use software and code from various big names a long time ago. But it was not until March of this year that I had the idea of using Github to host LAE! Although my current level is very amateur, I hope that one day I can also contribute to this big family! Keep going!!!
