[{"title":"Web introduction","path":"/2024/08/11/web_introduction/","content":"IntroductionWelcome to my website! The functionality of the website is very, very simple. It is currently not bound to a private server, so it is just a static site. In the future, I will add a server and make it ‚Äúcome alive‚Äù! What‚Äôs the content of this blog?This blog is overall an introduction! If you want to quickly understand me and my website, reading this one is enough! Hello! ü•≥ Who am I?I am Tang Jia, a senior psychology student~ What kind of person am I? I really love music! In terms of musical instruments, I once learned the piano and guitar for a while, but they have been gathering dust now‚Ä¶ I hope to pick them up again in the future! There are even more instruments that I treat as toys: harmonica, thumb piano, flute, hulusi, harmonica‚Ä¶ I can only play a few simple tunes on them (playing the flute is not as easy as it sounds!). A special thanks to my brother who gives me a small musical instrument every year! Hehe! Oh, by the way, does whistling count as a musical instrument? It took me about a month to master this skill! I really love sports! At first, it was to focus on health and help manage academic stress~ But after I unlocked push-ups and 5km, I started to fall in love with it and gradually approached pull-ups and 10km! A lot of sweat and endorphins! So much sense of achievement! And recently, the pressure has been particularly high‚Ä¶ If not for I used to love reading‚Ä¶ I will try to pick it up again! I used to read a lot of miscellaneous books and was a regular at the library. However, now I go to the library mainly for self-study‚Ä¶ Embarrassing‚Ä¶ üò≠ But thanks to my previous readings, if it weren‚Äôt for those books on cognitive science, philosophy of mind, sociology, and political science, I wouldn‚Äôt be on the path I am today~ What am I doing nowIn general, I am striving to achieve my academic ideals! Applying for further studiesBeing protected in a nutshell, still, my current state feels very hard‚Ä¶ Anxiety, confusion, procrastination, and other issues often emerge to bombard me. Looking around, I feel that everyone is under a lot of pressure and very tired‚Ä¶ This is just a statement from a student who is still protected by the school‚Äôs ivory tower! So, there are so many people in the world with much worse conditions and more unfortunate‚Ä¶ What should they do? I used to struggle a lot with this question. On one hand, I felt that I had to do something, but on the other hand, I felt powerless and too insignificant. Later, I gradually realized that this issue is very complex, and what I can do and how much I can do is also a question that needs to be explored slowly! I can‚Äôt figure it out now with a lack of information and practical experience! I can‚Äôt just lose hope foolishly and waste time internally without actually doing anything! So, if my academic abilities are still sufficient, and if I am lucky, perhaps I can research? Continue to learn and explore while doing something useful for everyone? It‚Äôs difficult to go in the direction I want to go in for further studies in China, and most places abroad are very expensive‚Ä¶ So, I am currently trying to apply to Japan! This opportunity is really delightful: When I was a junior, in order to play games, I bit the bullet and started to learn Japanese on my own. Then one thing led to another‚Ä¶ If I were to go back two years and tell myself that I would study abroad in Japan, I would definitely not believe it. I was very, very fortunate to find a project in Japan that perfectly matches my interests! But due to the issue of professional span, I might be eliminated‚Ä¶ Thinking about this, I can‚Äôt help but feel the pressure is overwhelming üò≠ But I would rather regret than regret not trying at the time! Keep going! After all, I really want to learn about promoting well-being for myself and everyone else! Keep going!!! Learning and Exploring LAE Program - The big picture!When I was a junior, I gradually established my goal, I want to LIVE AND ENJOY!!! Later, I realized that the ‚ÄòA‚Äô in LAE stands for AND üò≠ ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs okay! AND is also very important! If others don‚Äôt value you, I do! Then I started to write some programs with Python to help me achieve this (later I found out that the LAE program‚Äôs function is actually to assist self-regulation). Currently, the PC version of the program has more features, which can record what I do every day, how much time I spend, generate markdown notes (linked with Obsidian), and summarize and analyze. It can also remind me to stand up and take a break when I‚Äôve been using it for too long. But this is far from enough! So, I am developing the mobile version (LAE_kivy), with the ultimate goal of connecting all individual electronic devices! And I am trying to develop this website, from being a one-man show to going online! Github - Is this open-source ideology?! I started using Github to download and use software and code from various big names a long time ago. But it was not until March of this year that I had the idea of using Github to host LAE! Although my current level is very amateur, I hope that one day I can also contribute to this big family! Keep going!!!

In my graduation thesis, I focused on two typical aspects of self-regulation: anxiety and procrastination. Using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and multilevel logistic regression analysis, I discovered that procrastination and anxiety are influenced by moderating variables, with a positive predictive relationship particularly when the expectation of success is low. My thesis work highlighted the need for information technologies to capture dynamic relationships and develop practical interventions for self-regulation. Information technologies offer the potential to acquire meaningful data to understand an individual‚Äôs cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and situational states, including environmental factors like natural surroundings and social contexts. Therefore they aid in identification, prediction, and intervention to support decision-making and appropriate behaviors, with enhanced accuracy from incorporating environmental data such as air quality, noise levels, and social interactions. For further explanation of the relevant theories, please refer to: This Building on these possibilities, my current interest focuses on utilizing information technology to enhance self-regulation and promote well-being. By integrating environmental factors into technological solutions, we can develop effective interventions to improve mental health and quality of life, acknowledging that both technology and environment significantly influence well-being. Study and Research ThemesI hope to study the following themes after enrollment to better use information technology to aid self-regulation and promote well-being: Enhanced Data Sources. I aim to use mobile and wearable devices for passive data collection and employ spatial big data and spatiotemporal analysis for more ecological and instant data. Wearable and mobile devices, through digital sensor technology, can monitor individuals‚Äô daily activities in real-time, such as steps taken, heart rate, and sleep quality. This technology provides multi-modal data collection, enabling analysis and understanding of individual health status from multiple dimensions. Compared to traditional methods, wearable devices can continuously collect data in natural environments, enhancing the ecological validity of research. They also offer significant cost-efficiency, making large-scale deployment feasible. Using spatial big data and spatiotemporal analysis can further enrich data sources, providing comprehensive insights into the interactions between individuals and their environments. Understanding Environment and Context. To better understand user behavior and states, I hope to study context-aware technologies to identify current contexts from data, with a focus on environmental impacts, particularly how urban spaces affect individual mental health and behavior. Context-aware technology can analyze and respond to environmental changes in real-time, providing intelligent and personalized services, thus enhancing user experience. Unlike traditional methods, context-aware systems can continuously collect and process data, predict future scenarios, and take preemptive measures. By analyzing current environmental data and user behavior, context-aware technology offers smarter, safer, and more comfortable user experiences, meeting personalized needs, and improving well-being and self-regulation capabilities. Additionally, studying the impact of urban spaces can shed light on how different environments influence mental health and behavior. Broadening Research Perspectives: From Individual to Group. I plan to expand my research focus from individual self-regulation to group behavior and collective health, considering both internal dynamics and the influence of the environment on groups. Researching from a team perspective can fill the gaps left by individual-focused studies, providing insights into collective benefits such as overall health improvements. Interactions and social support within teams can enhance motivation and participation, helping individuals overcome obstacles and maintain healthy behaviors. Compared to individual perspectives, team perspectives highlight the importance of social connections and can help design interventions that meet diverse needs. By also considering the impact of the environment on group dynamics, we can better understand how spatial interactions influence collective well-being. Preliminary Research PlanHere is a preliminary research plan, which will be refined after enrolling and studying the themes above. I plan to utilize momentary self-assessment data combined with usage logs and passive data collected from various electronic devices to identify, predict, and ultimately intervene in anxiety and procrastination. Current Plan Diagram Phase 1: Developing the Relationship Model and Identification AlgorithmsData collection will involve software on devices to record self-assessments, usage logs, and heart rate data. As for model and algorithms, Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling will filter indicators and establish a model between anxiety and procrastination. Meanwhile, association rule mining will link scenarios, usage, and heart rate data to identify anxiety and procrastination. Phase 2: Establishing Intervention Mechanisms and Designing Intervention SoftwareEstablishing Intervention Mechanisms: Critical predictive points for procrastination will be identified. If anxiety is detected, intervention measures such as alerts or reminders will be applied to manage anxiety and reduce procrastination risks. Designing Intervention Software: User interviews will gather intervention requirements, and software functionalities will be designed accordingly, adhering to ethical and privacy standards. Phase 3: Deploying and Testing the Intervention SoftwareIts effectiveness will be tested through tracking users‚Äô anxiety and procrastination levels, semi-structured interviews, and satisfaction scales. Limitations and Future AspirationThe previous section has the following issues: Technical and Thematic Limitations: There is a need to learn more about various passive mobile and wearable sensing platforms to acquire multimodal data effectively. Moreover, well-being encompasses a wide range of topics beyond anxiety, procrastination, or self-regulation. I am open to exploring other themes involving interactions between individuals and their environments that promote well-being. Perspective Limitations: Currently, my perspective is limited to the individual. By enrolling, I aim to engage with diverse groups to understand their dynamics and specific needs, thereby broadening my research scope. Additionally, the preliminary plan lacks sufficient focus on spatial and environmental factors. Future research will incorporate environmental data, such as urban space impacts, to understand how different environments influence anxiety, procrastination, and overall well-being."},{"title":"LAE","path":"/2024/06/22/LAE/","content":"Live and Enjoy!!!!‚ÄîLAE system ü•≥What is this?This is a personal motto I‚Äôve formed during my university years! Life is not easy, and I truly wish that I and others can achieve this goal! It also reflects my simple understanding of life, which is that happiness and joy require effort! ‚ÄúEnjoy‚Äù requires efforts! Of course, happiness in this world is not something that can be guaranteed with equal effort‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs another grand issue! LAE Program and Academic InterestsforewordStarting from my junior year, I began to write a series of simple programs with the goal of LAE to help myself achieve happiness better. With the study of theory, I gradually realized that what I was doing was actually assisting self-regulation through digital tools. For detailed descriptions of the program, please refer to the explanation on GitHub. As I continued to learn and explore, I slowly realized that I wanted to learn more knowledge and technology to better accomplish this task. At the same time, I also questioned and pondered whether doing this alone (assisting self-regulation) could lead to true happiness and joy. With these questions in mind, I decided to continue my research in the field of HCI√óWelfare during my master‚Äôs studies. However, this path may not be very smooth. I don‚Äôt know if I am fortunate enough, or if I can persist to the end amidst pressure and uncertainty. Everything is still uncertain. But as long as there is hope, then let‚Äôs continue to strive! Keep going!!!! Theoretical BasisHCI‚Üíself-regulation‚Üíwell-beingLeveraging HCI methodologies to enhance human well-being is a field I am committed to for my career, largely due to the profound impact of digital technology. This technology is omnipresent and creates myriad possibilities for understanding and manipulating our environment. Currently there is an increasing emphasis on humanistic approaches in computing, notably through the concept of ‚Äòpositive computing‚Äô. My vision aligns with this perspective: to use HCI to develop digital tools that promote personal wellness. Through academic study, literature reviews, and personal experiences, I have identified the development of self-regulation digital tools as a particularly promising direction. These tools, powered by computing, could significantly improve individual well-being. 1. Self-regulation to Well-being:Self-regulation involves an individual monitoring and regulating their own behaviors, thoughts, and emotions to achieve specific goals. The essence of this process is making responses that are beneficial to ultimate objectives. Effective self-regulation can align behaviors and emotions with both hedonic and eudaimonic forms of happiness , thereby promoting well-being. 2. HCI to Self-regulation:In daily life, humans often make erroneous responses that detract from well-being. However, using personal electronic devices to collect, record, analyze, identify, and then prompt interventions holds great potential. Generally, there are two aspects: Firstly, with the widespread use of electronic devices and their daily operation by humans, accessing large amounts of data becomes convenient and meaningful. Devices can both automatically generate extensive passive data and reduce the burden of gathering self-reported data. This data encompasses real-time insights into an individual‚Äôs cognition, emotions, behaviors, and contexts, forming valuable time series. Based on this: Secondly, utilizing data for identification, prediction, and intervention facilitates self-regulation. The mechanisms that enhance self-regulation can be explained using the Habit Alteration Model (HAM). HAM posits that situational cues are filtered through two types of attention processes: automatic and unconscious (Type I), and deliberate and slower (Type II), before entering memory. This may generate competing behavioral drives (impulses and intentions) forming potential response options. These options compete and are influenced by self-control. Ultimately, the choice that surpasses the threshold becomes the individual‚Äôs actual response, which is also recorded through self-monitoring and tracking. HAM model diagram (screenshot from literature) And computer technology plays a crucial role in the ‚Äúenvironment ‚Üí behavioral intentions&#x2F;impulses ‚Üí actual response‚Äù process. ‚ë†Digital tools alter the environment an individual is in, undoubtedly affecting their emotions and behaviors. As electronic devices are a significant component of our environment, digital technology can foster a conducive setting and provide appropriate cues, increasing the likelihood of desired emotional and behavioral outcomes. ‚ë°Digital tools also influence the connection between situational cues and behavioral intentions&#x2F;impulses. On one hand, these tools help link an individual‚Äôs intentions with corresponding situations, gradually automating them (i.e., the situation automatically triggers impulses), known as ‚ÄúImplementation Intentions.‚Äù On the other hand, programs can automatically detect situations and provide ‚Äújust-in-time reminders‚Äù to stimulate intentions, leading to actions. Both directions are worthy of exploration. ‚ë¢Digital tools can provide feedback or even intervene in an individual‚Äôs actual responses. On one hand, by recording, digital tools offer precise information for self-monitoring and suggest remedial measures, aiding in the formation of healthier, conscious behavioral intentions‚Äî a core focus of Personal Informatics. On the other hand, they can respond to individual reactions, such as using gamification mechanisms to alter the expected rewards of specific behaviors or even directly block certain actions, like screen locking. To sum up, the core mechanism of HCI-assisted self-regulation is providing information to aid decision-making and helping induce appropriate behavioral intentions and impulses in response to situations.
