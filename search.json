The functionality of the website is very, very simple. It is currently not bound to a private server, so it is just a static site. In the future, I will add a server and make it “come alive”! What’s the content of this blog?This blog is overall an introduction! If you want to quickly understand me and my website, reading this one is enough! Hello! 🥳 Who am I?I am Tang Jia, a senior psychology student~ What kind of person am I? I really love music! In terms of musical instruments, I once learned the piano and guitar for a while, but they have been gathering dust now… I hope to pick them up again in the future! There are even more instruments that I treat as toys: harmonica, thumb piano, flute, hulusi, harmonica… I can only play a few simple tunes on them (playing the flute is not as easy as it sounds!). A special thanks to my brother who gives me a small musical instrument every year! Hehe! Oh, by the way, does whistling count as a musical instrument? It took me about a month to master this skill! I really love sports! At first, it was to focus on health and help manage academic stress~ But after I unlocked push-ups and 5km, I started to fall in love with it and gradually approached pull-ups and 10km! A lot of sweat and endorphins! So much sense of achievement! And recently, the pressure has been particularly high… If not for I used to love reading… I will try to pick it up again! I used to read a lot of miscellaneous books and was a regular at the library. However, now I go to the library mainly for self-study… Embarrassing… 😭 But thanks to my previous readings, if it weren’t for those books on cognitive science, philosophy of mind, sociology, and political science, I wouldn’t be on the path I am today~ What am I doing nowIn general, I am striving to achieve my academic ideals! Applying for further studiesBeing protected in a nutshell, still, my current state feels very hard… Anxiety, confusion, procrastination, and other issues often emerge to bombard me. Looking around, I feel that everyone is under a lot of pressure and very tired… This is just a statement from a student who is still protected by the school’s ivory tower! So, there are so many people in the world with much worse conditions and more unfortunate… What should they do? I used to struggle a lot with this question. On one hand, I felt that I had to do something, but on the other hand, I felt powerless and too insignificant. Later, I gradually realized that this issue is very complex, and what I can do and how much I can do is also a question that needs to be explored slowly! I can’t figure it out now with a lack of information and practical experience! I can’t just lose hope foolishly and waste time internally without actually doing anything! So, if my academic abilities are still sufficient, and if I am lucky, perhaps I can research? Continue to learn and explore while doing something useful for everyone? It’s difficult to go in the direction I want to go in for further studies in China, and most places abroad are very expensive… So, I am currently trying to apply to Japan! This opportunity is really delightful: When I was a junior, in order to play games, I bit the bullet and started to learn Japanese on my own. Then one thing led to another… If I were to go back two years and tell myself that I would study abroad in Japan, I would definitely not believe it. I was very, very fortunate to find a project in Japan that perfectly matches my interests! But due to the issue of professional span, I might be eliminated… Thinking about this, I can’t help but feel the pressure is overwhelming 😭 But I would rather regret than regret not trying at the time! Keep going! After all, I really want to learn about promoting well-being for myself and everyone else! Keep going!!! Learning and Exploring LAE Program - The big picture!When I was a junior, I gradually established my goal, I want to LIVE AND ENJOY!!! Later, I realized that the ‘A’ in LAE stands for AND 😭 … It’s okay! AND is also very important! If others don’t value you, I do! Then I started to write some programs with Python to help me achieve this (later I found out that the LAE program’s function is actually to assist self-regulation). Currently, the PC version of the program has more features, which can record what I do every day, how much time I spend, generate markdown notes (linked with Obsidian), and summarize and analyze. It can also remind me to stand up and take a break when I’ve been using it for too long. But this is far from enough! So, I am developing the mobile version (LAE_kivy), with the ultimate goal of connecting all individual electronic devices! And I am trying to develop this website, from being a one-man show to going online! Github - Is this open-source ideology?! I started using Github to download and use software and code from various big names a long time ago. But it was not until March of this year that I had the idea of using Github to host LAE! Although my current level is very amateur, I hope that one day I can also contribute to this big family! Keep going!!!

Further study and personal experiences led me to identify procrastination and anxiety as two significant phenomena impacting well-being. Past contrary findings indicate that the relationship between anxiety and procrastination is more complex than it appears. This inspired my thesis project, which explores the complex dynamics between them. To address this complexity, I included a moderator, employed the Experience Sampling Method to gather daily data over a week, and analyzed the data using a multilevel logistic regression model. The findings revealed a positive predictive relationship between anxiety and procrastination, especially when the expectation of success(moderator) was low. However, my thesis work made me realize that current methodologies are inadequate for capturing the dynamic and complex interactions between these variables. More importantly, I’m eager to develop practical interventions to better address this issue. Through programming and literature review, I discovered my true passion: integrating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with well-being. HCI→self-regulation→well-beingHCI technology facilitates self-regulation through the development of digital tools, with the following key points: Computer technology enables the acquisition of convenient and meaningful data. These data can be used to unobtrusively understand an individual’s momentary cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and situational data, and generate time-series. Particularly, usage logs from electronic devices are an excellent form of passive data (requiring no participant input),reflecting various user states. Utilizing this data aids in identification, prediction, and intervention, thus benefiting self-regulation. Based on the Habit Alteration Model, computer technology plays a crucial role in the process “environment → behavioral intentions&#x2F;impulses → actual response.” The core mechanism of HCI-assisted self-regulation is providing information to support decision-making and facilitating the appropriate behavioral intentions and impulses. Specifically, researchers have explored how digital technology influences individual behavioral responses through the following pathways: Firstly, electronic devices are often crucial components of the environment. Digital technology can thus provide appropriate cues to increase the likelihood of desired emotions and behaviors. Secondly, digital tools can influence the connection between the context and behavioral intentions&#x2F;impulses. By helping individuals link their goal-oriented intentions with corresponding situations (implementation intentions), or by automatically detecting and providing just-in-time reminders to stimulate intentions, these tools can help trigger targeted behaviors. Lastly, digital tools can record, feedback, and even interfere with an individual’s actual responses. By recording, they provide precise information for self-monitoring, aiding individuals in forming healthier and more conscious behavioral intentions. Also, they can respond to individual actions, for example, using gamified mechanisms to alter the expected rewards of specific behaviors, or even directly inhibit certain actions, such as by locking screens. Building on these possibilities, I plan to explore the following in my next phase of research: Future Research PlanI plan to utilize momentary self-assessment data combined with device usage records to identify, predict, and ultimately intervene in anxiety and procrastination. Phase 1: Developing the Relationship Model and Identification Algorithms1.1 Data collection will involve deploying software on both computers and mobile devices to record momentary self-assessments of anxiety and auxiliary variables, also device usage logs. 1.2 For model and algorithms : Ⅰ Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling will be used to filter effective auxiliary indicators (task ambiguity, for instance) and establish a dynamic model between anxiety and procrastination. Ⅱ Association rule mining will develop rules linking scenarios, device usage, and their associations with anxiety and procrastination（user self-rate）→enabling the identification of anxiety and procrastination based on electronic device usage behaviors. Phase 2: Establishing Intervention Mechanisms and Designing Intervention Software2.1 Establishing Intervention Mechanisms–The planned start time for the target task is designated as T1 (user-defined). Based on Ⅰ, a critical predictive point for procrastination, labeled as T0, is identified. Using Ⅱ, if anxiety is detected at T0, intervention measures will be applied: Example scenario one: T0 is at the night（bedtime）before T1. At T0, the software detects high anxiety behavior→Conduct self-assessment for anxiety and task ambiguity→If high anxiety and low ambiguity→Alert: “High risk of procrastination tomorrow. Please consider putting your phone away before T1 to reduce likelihood.” (Implementation Intentions) Example scenario two: T0 is 10 minutes before T1. At T0, the software detects high anxiety behavior.→Perform anxiety self-assessment→If high anxiety → Alert: “Note specific task steps and risks of procrastination. Consider deep breathing and disengaging from current activities.” (Just-in-time Reminder) 2.2 Designing Intervention Software–Through user interviews, I will gather intervention requirements and design the intervention functionalities of the software accordingly.Also to ensure the data collection adheres to strict ethical and privacy standards. Phase 3 Deploy the complete identification, prediction, and intervention software and test the effectiveness of different interventions. Methods of verification will include tracking users’ actual anxiety and procrastination levels, semi-structured interviews, and satisfaction scales to assess the impact of the interventions Value and Significance:Obtaining theoretical models, algorithms and software, enriching the related theoretical framework and assisting self-regulating, thereby enhancing overall well-being Limitations and Future AspirationThe previous section has following issues: 1. Simplicity of Techniques; To enhance prediction accuracy and reduce user burden, I aim to explore and study more complex algorithms, multimodal data, and richer, more intelligent “interventions” (for instance, using LLM to generate reminder text). 2. Theoretical Gaps - True Happiness? The current approach overlooks the spontaneity of self-improvement and the importance of social connections. This can lead to tools that promote excessive self-optimization and competition, treating individuals more like market commodities rather than truly enhancing well-being. Researchers increasingly argue that HCI often views well-being as merely a personal responsibility, overlooking social environmental impacts and the non-neutrality of technology. By integrating these insights, future designs could aim for systems that are transparent, understandable, and thus facilitate interactions that align with individual needs and value orientations. Therefore, Phase 2 will focus on communication with users through interviews to tailor specific intervention features, and I hope to learn how to design software that aligns with this direction. This video greatly inspired me! Check it out if interested~ 3. Limited Perspective; This is currently limited by personal experience and predominantly focuses on the general population from an individual perspective. More researchers are turning their attention to vulnerable groups and the interactions within these communities. Addressing this could also be an important direction to solve the issues mentioned above. I hope to have opportunities to engage with diverse groups in the future, to understand and learn from their needs, and to study how individual interactions with the environment and within groups can be facilitated."},{"title":"Learning 日本語 with the Help of AI!","path":"/2024/04/22/日本語_and_AI/","content":"IntroductionSince a slew of Large Language Models (LLMs) emerged, learning has become very free and flexible, especially when it comes to languages!

Life is not easy, and I truly wish that I and others can achieve this goal! It also reflects my simple understanding of life, which is that happiness and joy require effort! “Enjoy” requires efforts! Of course, happiness in this world is not something that can be guaranteed with equal effort… That’s another grand issue! LAE Program and Academic InterestsStarting from my junior year, I began to write a series of simple programs with the goal of LAE to help myself achieve happiness better. With the study of theory, I gradually realized that what I was doing was actually assisting self-regulation through digital tools. For detailed descriptions of the program, please refer to the explanation on GitHub. As I continued to learn and explore, I slowly realized that I wanted to learn more knowledge and technology to better accomplish this task. At the same time, I also questioned and pondered whether doing this alone (assisting self-regulation) could lead to true happiness and joy. With these questions in mind, I decided to continue my research in the field of HCI×Welfare during my master’s studies. However, this path may not be very smooth. I don’t know if I am fortunate enough, or if I can persist to the end amidst pressure and uncertainty. Everything is still uncertain. But as long as there is hope, then let’s continue to strive! Keep going!!!!"}]
